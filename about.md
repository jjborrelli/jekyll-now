I am a Ph. D. candidate in [Ecology and Evolution](http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/) at Stony Brook University. 

My current advisor is [Dr. Lev Ginzburg](http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/ginzburglab/)

My current interests are centered around food web theory, and more generally ecological network structure.

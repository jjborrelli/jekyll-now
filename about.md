I am a Ph. D. candidate in [Ecology and Evolution](http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/) at Stony Brook University. My current advisor is [Dr. Lev Ginzburg](http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/ginzburglab/). 

I am fascinated by the structure, dynamics, and evolution of ecological networks and the
power of network tools to address ecological questions.

I often like to say that I want to find the “devious strategies” that Robert May invoked to
explain the persistence of complex communities. Instead, what I have found is that rather than
community configurations allowing complex communities to be stable, stability is the reason
communities are structured the way they are. Stability selection is rooted in this idea that
community configurations that are more stable will persist longer than those that are not. For two
strong food web patterns, short food chains and motifs, I have shown that the features of the
community that are most common are also the most stable. Using the random matrix approach
pioneered by Stefano Allesina, I showed that not only are short chains stable, but model webs
with shorter average chains are also more likely to be stable, all else being equal ([Borrelli and Ginzburg 2014](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352249614000056)).
Tritrophic chains, apparent competition, and direct competition are all well studied community
configurations, possibly because they are more likely to be stable configurations leading them to
be frequently present in food webs ([Borrelli 2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/oik.02176/abstract)). These results show a strong signature of
exactly what we would expect from stability selection acting on food webs.

I was first introduced to R in a Biometry course (one that I later TAed) and I have found
programming to be an incredibly useful tool in my research. My passion and enjoyment of
programming is what has allowed me to primarily teach myself by reading other people’s code
on blogs, lengthy discussion with colleagues, and tackling new problems. I am now a skilled
programmer in R and constantly trying to push the limits of what it can do. Beyond learning to 
parallelize my code to increase the power and speed of simulations I am currently learning how
to integrate R with C++ through the Rcpp package.

My work with networks has had a great impact on my learning to code, as I first started to
teach myself with the igraph package. Now, I write a blog (mostly on Wordpress, but slowly moving to Github) where I post snippets of code (and
commentary on papers) and my most popular post is a tutorial that I wrote to introduce people to
network analysis with igraph ([part 1](https://assemblingnetwork.wordpress.com/2013/05/29/network-basics-with-r-and-igraph-part-i-of-iii/), [part 2](https://assemblingnetwork.wordpress.com/2013/06/10/network-basics-with-r-and-igraph-part-ii-of-iii/), [part 3](https://assemblingnetwork.wordpress.com/2013/07/01/network-basics-with-r-and-igraph-part-iii-of-iii/)). I have demonstrated my ability to use R for numerical
simulations and statistical analysis ([you can view my work on GitHub here](https://github.com/jjborrelli)). Beyond just using R
for my work I helped with a Software Carpentry workshop at New York University and I am
completing training to become an instructor for the organization. Not only do I seek to push the
limits of what I can do in R, but I am looking for other opportunities such as learning to utilize
the many Python toolkits for research (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, etc.) by taking a course on Python.

I always enjoy learning something new, and I have made it a priority to
absorb as much as I can during my graduate studies. I spent two weeks with Jordi Bascompte’s
lab in Seville to learn the best tools and techniques to study networks. Recently, I also attended a
workshop in Lausanne, Switzerland to both share my research and learn more from several
prominent ecologists.

			<p>I am interested in applying <font color = "green" size = 4pt>network theory</font> and <font color = "green" size = 4pt>tools</font> to study ecological questions about <u>community structure and dynamics</u>. Network tools can help to define and understand how interactions between species in a community are patterned.My primary interest is in studying how different patterns in <font color = "green" size = 4pt>food webs</font> relate to <font color = "green" size = 4pt>stability</font> at the community and population level. </p>
